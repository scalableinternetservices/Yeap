This is team Yeap!

We are going to build something similar to "Yelp". Basically, it includes thousands of places for people to meet up, and users can browse information about places through this website.


Things we may want to cover:

Ruby version
* 2.2.1

System dependencies
* ubuntu 14.04 lts

Configuration


Database creation
* use rake db:migrate

Database initialization
* use rake db:seed

How to run the test suite

Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

Deployment instructions

...


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
